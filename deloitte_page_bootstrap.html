<h5>Everything "consumer" is changing these days, from how one buys groceries to how one books hotel rooms or catches a ride. And with it comes new demands on consumer sector industries.

<h5>Perhaps disruption has become a bit of a buzzword, but there are few places it is more fitting than in the energy, resources, and industrial sectors. Scarcity, population growth, market forces, cultural norms, security, technology transformation—it all influences our work in oil, gas & chemicals; power & utilities; industrial products & construction; and renewables. This creates dynamic career opportunities across Deloitte's service offerings, but our work here also provides the opportunity to help impact public health and prosperity, the modernization and security of infrastructure, and the direction civilization takes on a host of planet-shaping issues.</h5>
